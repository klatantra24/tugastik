There’s no single way to define what a year 2022 has been. Coming back after 
<br>
a few years of uncertainty has led each of us to create a “new normal” in our
<br>
relationships to culture—and to each other. This year, Spotify listeners took the
<br>
 chance to redefine how they find joy. 
<br>
<br>
And now, it’s time to unveil what the world collectively delighted in and obsessed over
<br>
 with Spotify’s 2022 Wrapped.From the music that makes us  dance to the to the podcasts
<br>
 that keep us riveted, this is the audio that bubbled to the top of Spotify listeners’ playlists.

<br>
It’s a three-peat for global recording artist Bad Bunny. The singer-songwriter is the year’s most-streamed artist
<br>
in the world on Spotify—a spot he’s held since 2020. No other artist has ever accomplished the feat before, so  
<br>

to celebrate, we’ve turned the heart button on Spotify into the singer’s custom red-heart icon.
<br>
<br>
Taylor Swift held true to her invitation to meet her at midnight, and it propelled her to become the second-most
<br>
-streamed artist of the year globally —and the top artist in Australia, the U.K., Ireland, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
<br>
New Zealand, Qatar, Slovenia, and Singapore. Rounding out the top five artists are the two very familiar Toronto 
<br>
powerhouses Drake and The Weeknd, along with K-Pop band BTS.

<br>
<br>
Plenty of artists had their worlds rocked this year by the power of social media. The most “viral” artists were 
<br>
those  who had their music most frequently shared to social platforms from Spotify. Taylor Swift’s Midnights   
<br>
release certainly got the world talking, and she claims the top spot as the most viral artist globally. 
<br>
<br>
The second place position goes to The Weeknd, followed by Bad Bunny. Rounding out spots four and five 
<br>
are BTS and Lana Del Rey.
