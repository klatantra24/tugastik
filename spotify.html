<br>
the course of the past 12 months, music fans  discovered plenty of new 
<br>
artists and rekindled their love for old favorites. Of course, some albums 
<br>
stood out more than others, with a handful of artists earning a billion 
<br>
streams on just one singlealone. 
<br>
<br>
Spotify took a look at the numbers and calculated just which albums were 
<br>
the most popular and the top five will probably come as no surprise!
